# TrackingFloat
This package implements a new type of float that remembers the biggest number it has seen. It keeps two fields, one Float64 that acts as a normal float under all the specified operations in src, and one field that keeps track of the largest number (in absolute value) that has been involved in generating this TrackingFloat.
